    <p>At Damshi Aadishakti Foundation, we believe that everyone deserves the chance to live a healthy and fulfilling
        life. Our mission is to improve the lives of people in need by providing access to basic necessities such as
        food, shelter, education, and healthcare. We work tirelessly to identify the most pressing needs in our
        community and develop programs and initiatives to address those needs. </p>
    <p>Through our fundraising efforts and the generous support of our donors, we are able to make a positive impact on
        the lives of thousands of people every year. Whether it's providing a warm meal to someone in need or helping a
        child receive an education, we are dedicated to making a difference in our community and beyond.</p>

    Damshi aadishakti foundation founded on (date) with a commitment (to help the needy)
    Behind every beginning lies a thought/idea that holds powr to change the world/society and so in year ( ) it come
    into existence with a consideration/observation WHICH transmuted our prospective that how even a small thing can
    have great power to make a difference. in our daily life we all have somewhere underestimated the power of Rs1 and
    on the other hand ngo requires people's support for social work through donations and here we click with an idea
    that what if despite collecting thousands from one person we collect Rs1 from thousands of people .along with doable
    donation we will be having coordination and support of those thousands of people who might have ever thought of
    working for the society but could not do it due to deficiency of money
